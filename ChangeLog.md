# 4.0.7
- Broadened the regex `Invoke-ReimageComputer` uses to search for network boot devices.
- Added some error handling to `Invoke-ReimageComputer`

# 4.0.6
- Added `Invoke-ReimageComputer`

# 4.0.5
- Fixed the duplicate check in New-OSDMakeModel.

# 4.0.4
- Fixed a formatting issue where OSDComputers would not show their MacAddress

# 4.0.3
- Fixed a bug where the MacAddress of a computer could not be updated with Set-OSDComputer.
- Fixed a bug where a computer with a value of DBNull for the MacAddress could not be accessed or modified.
- Corrected documentation for `Set-OSDComputerState -State`.
- Added additional switches `-Staged` and `-Unstaged` to Set-OSDComputerState.

# 4.0.2
Removed ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName for all parameters on Set-OSDComputer, Set-OSDComputerState, and Set-OSDMakeModel. It is now possible to pipe Get-OSDComputer into Set-OSDComputer.

# 4.0.1
Fixed a bug where Get-OSDComputer would throw an error from SQL while trying to get all computers.

# 4.0.0
Renamed the module Cofl.OSDManagement and removed references to the old module name.
Introduced a cleaner workflow.

 - Initialize-OSD has been renamed to Connect-OSD
   - The -Path parameter is now mandatory and has the alias MDTSharePath.
   - The -UseConfiguredPath parameter has been added.
   - The -Refresh parameter has been removed.
   - The -DefaultOU and -ComputerNameTemplate parameters have been added.
   - An [OSDAlreadyConnectedException] will be thrown if already connected, and -Force is not specified.
   Default values for -Path, -DefaultOU, and -ComputerNameTemplate are configurable, see below.
 - Disconnect-OSD has been added as a counterpart to Connect-OSD.
   - Disconnect-OSD is called automatically on module remove.
 - All cmdlets except for Connect-OSD, Disconnect-OSD and Update-OSDConfiguration will now throw an [OSDNotConnectedException] if Connect-OSD has not been run or failed to connect.
Added a dependency on the Configuration module.
 - Default values can be configured using the Configuration module. See Configuration.psd1 at the module root for an example.
 - Added the Update-OSDConfiguration cmdlet for help with updating your configuration.
 - Configuration is no longer done from the module data (ðŸŽ‰)
 - An option is available for auto initialize on import, which is now disabled by default.
 - Added the about_Cofl.OSDManagement_Configuration help article.
Cmdlets:
 - Replaced the OSD* types with *Binding types in parameters.
 - Changed -Folder to -Group in Get-OSDTaskSequence
 - Added Set-OSDMakeModel (provides similar functionality to Set-OSDComputer for MakeModels)
 - Added Remove-OSDMakeModel (removes MakeModels like Remove-OSDComputer removes computers)
 - Added Set-OSDComputerState (unifies ActiveDirectory state cmdlets and provides more flexibility)
 - Removed Set-OSDMakeModelTaskSequence (use Set-OSDMakeModel)
 - Removed Set-OSDMakeModelDriverGroup (use Set-OSDMakeModel)
 - Removed Set-OSDComputerStaged (use Set-OSDComputerState -State Staged)
 - Removed Set-OSDComputerDestaged (use Set-OSDComputerState -State Unstaged)
 - Renamed Update-OSDAutoCompleteCaches to Update-OSDAutoCompleteCache (PSScriptAnalyzer recommendation)
 - Merged Test-OSDComputerExists and Test-OSDComputerStaged into Test-OSDComputer with either the -Exists or -Staged switch.
 - New-OSDComputer will now no longer create ADComputer objects by default (effectively, -MDTOnly is now the default.)
   - The -MDTOnly switch has been removed.
   - Added switches -CreateADComputerIfMissing, -MoveADComputer, and -Stage
 - Removed all aliases for Get-OSDComputer -Identity as they were misleading and archaic
 - Renamed Set-OSDComputer -Computer to Set-OSDComputer -Identity
 - Renamed Remove-OSDComputer -Computer to Remove-OSDComputer -Identity
Classes:
 - Removed the about_Cofl.OSDManagement_classes help article.
 - Removed OSDMacAddress. It has been replaced by MacAddressBinding.
 - Renamed OSDTaskSequenceFolder to OSDTaskSequenceGroup (this is the proper name)
Add properties:
 - OSDComputer.Description (references the identity table description)
 - OSDComputer.SerialNumber (references the identity table SerialNumber)
 - OSDMakeModel.InternalID (references the internal database ID)
Changed properties:
 - OSDComputer.OSDComputerName -> OSDComputer.ComputerName
 - OSDComputer.ID -> OSDComputer.InternalID
 - OSDComputer.InTmpSetup -> OSDComputer.IsInDefaultOU
 - OSDComputer.ADComputerPresent -> OSDComputer.IsADComputerPresent
Changed aliases:
 - OSDComputer.ComputerName -> OSDComputer.OSDComputerName (ComputerName is now the property name)
Removed aliases:
 - OSDComputer.MAC (use OSDComputer.MacAddress)
 - OSDComputer.InTempSetup (use OSDComputer.IsInDefaultOU)
 - OSDComputer.Staged (use OSDComputer.IsStaged)
 - OSDComputer.TS (use OSDComputer.TaskSequence)
 - OSDMakeModel.DG (use OSDMakeModel.DriverGroup)
 - OSDMakeModel.TS (use OSDMakeModel.TaskSequence)
Updated Type and Format data:
 - OSDComputer.Name is now OSDComputer.ComputerName in the default display property set.
